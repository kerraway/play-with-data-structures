#### Play with data structures

In this repository, I will write some common data structures:

1. array
2. stack and queue
3. binary search tree
4. set and map based on binary search tree
5. heap
6. priority queue
7. segment tree
8. trie
9. AVL tree
10. red and black tree
11. hash table

and use these data structures to solve some leetcode problems.
